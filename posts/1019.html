    This morning I had my first exam in Uppsala. It began at 8am and the testing location was a half 
    an hour bus ride away, which had me setting my alarm for 6:30am. When I got to the testing site
    the doors were closed with people waiting in the lobby. Every once in a while, a man or woman 
    would open the doors and give instructions totally in Swedish. The whole testing experience 
    went fine, but I had a lot of second guesses. For example, my answer sheet went to ten questions,
    but the test only had five free response questions. I had that thought that maybe I had to turn 
    in the first part to get the second part of the exam, but didn't know because I didn't understand
    the Swedish instructions.

    I also didn't understand how they would issue me a grade because there was not a place for a name 
    on the exam, so I just wrote my name and student ID at the top. When I turned it in, they told 
    me I shouldn't have done this, but the woman was super helpful and we whited it out. Besides
    not being sure where I was supposed to be or what I was supposed to do at times, the exam seemed to go
    fine. I left pretty early compared to everyone else, and I think I passed.

    I hope the blog is loading faster. Just before this post, I wrote a script that replaces the 
    full resolution images with low res ones. Once the page has the full res assets loaded it'll swap the 
    low-res image for the full size image. This blog is one of the only projects I've worked on where
    it was less about the code. I don't want to write all these optimizations and make the site beautiful, 
    which you've probably already noticed. I would rather I spend time on the content.

    This week I turned down a summer internship offer that paid pretty darn well, and I don't have another 
    offer in front of me yet. I'm going totally against the advice, "a bird in the hand is worth two in 
    the bush". Kind of a silly phrase when applied to life decisions like a girlfriend or summer job.
    "Well I was gonna break up with her, but you know what they say, don't want to grab at two birds and 
    come up empty". With girls and jobs there are way more than just the first two birds even if you miss
    those. I'm trying to land a position at a smaller company or a startup. I don't know;
    we'll see what happens I guess. I'm thrown my resume at a lot of places and already been interviewed 
    by Google, so I'm certainly not worried.

    This last week I started into some Unity development. For the non-nerds of the world, Unity is a game
    development engine. I went ahead and created a flappy bird clone already which is cool. It's an odd
    feeling to be an extremely capable programmer but not knowing how to create what seems like the easy 
    things like animations and images.
    It would be nice to work in a team with a designer who can really make the game shine. 
    From what I can tell from the last week, the details are what really give it that edge. As with anything
    if I don't become disinterested in it, I'll get better with practice.

    That's it. I'll write my next post before bed to ensure the ultimate creativity of topics. Vi ses!
