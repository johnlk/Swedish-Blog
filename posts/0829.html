    I'm thinking about what I'm going to write this post about, and then I see that I had written "August 24st" 
    like an idiot on my last post heading to no correction for 5 days. You want people to read your blog but 
    after a mistake like that, you hope no one is reading your blog.

    Today was a little slow to start but a good day nonetheless. I was able to enjoy a welcome ceremony from Uppsala 
    University for its international population, which was a little boring but interesting too. I was able to 
    learn a good bit about the history of the "Nations" here at Uppsala as well as the founding history of the 
    University. Uppsala is actually the oldest University in Scandinavia founded in 1477 and one of the oldest 
    in all of Europe. The interesting parts of the history lesson revolved around the Student Nations. Back in 
    the 19th century when students would come to study, the time required to get back to Stockholm as an example
    was 2 days if the weather permitted, sometimes the trek took as much as 5. For a comparison, I was able to 
    take a train ride to Stockholm from Uppsala that lasted a half hour. In the 1800's, a student coming to study 
    at Uppsala was so much more disconnected from their family than a college student today. To compensate, the 
    Student Nations were founded and represented each of the regions in Sweden such that someone could keep up 
    with their communities at home. They were able to meet with people from their town, receive their local news
    through their Nation, and when one of the members made the trip back home, they would deliver mail to the other 
    members' family.

    Today, the Nations are still around, but are not based on the localities of Sweden from which you're from, and 
    many international students join them. They are unlike Greek housing in the US however because the Nations are 
    for both sexes, and no one lives at the nations. Most have their own pubs and libraries as well. Joining a Nation 
    means you can hop around to all the other Nations, so joining one isn't as big a decision as picking a Greek house
    which is the one and only you'll be a part of. Having that Nation card at Uppsala that comes from joining a Nation 
    gets you into all the others. I was able to join Gästrike-Hälsinge Nation yesterday afternoon because they had
    hosted a couple of fun events I had already been too, and I didn't want to worry about getting a Nation card 
    anymore.

    Beyond joining a Nation and hearing about Uppsala history, I was able to practice my Spanish last night as well 
    as today. Do you remember the ice breaker question, "what super power would you want in real life"? The classic 
    answers are flight, x-ray vision, the ability to teleport. None of those answers would give you the freedom the 
    super power of speaking every language would allow. I took Spanish for 3 years in high school and again for a 
    semester in college. I was good. Just after a year of not speaking it, I was horrible at conversing with native 
    speakers. To be able to just speak any language perfectly with no effort would allow you a freedom to travel, 
    meet, relate, and engage with people in a way only a few can now. One of the perks that enticed me, not enough 
    to fully commit to applying, about the CIA data science position I had a chance to apply for, was that they would 
    adjust your salary based on how many languages you were fluent in. Not only that, but they would pay to have a 
    tutor maintain those languages such that you wouldn't lose them. I would use that in a heartbeat as I'm passively
    losing my Spanish as it is, and need to learn Swedish. Then again English is the Universal language and everyone
    I meet, be they from Asia or Europe, they all speak English. So maybe I shouldn't feel bad for not having another 
    language when my native tongue is the universal one, and I don't have the dire need to learn that others have.
