    I think there's a saying about drinking alone, that it's a sign of alcoholism. Two nights ago
    I was drinking alone, but alcohol does something totally different to me. For most people, 
    alcohol is a depressant, and they slow down. Maybe they become a little less shy. When I drink,
    I want to get work done. If I have an essay for class I haven't written or a piece of code that's
    unfinished, it always seems to get done after I've had some drinks.

    The session two nights ago had me finishing a Github project that had lied untouched in a while. For
    the non-nerds of the world, Github is a website where you can host and share code. I had made a project
    with the goal of copying Chrome's dinosaur game but for the iPhone. The project when I found it
    just had a couple images from the original game and no real mechanics. But I'm glad to inform my 
    readers that with the help of the alcohol and a few hours of free time, I was able to finish the project.
    If you have a Github you should go <a href="https://github.com/johnlk/dinoRunner">give my project a like.</a>

    Looking at the game, it's not that it's that fun or unique, but it has a novelty to it. The dinosaur's
    legs running is pretty funny to watch, and its eyes bulging when it gets hit is equally great.
    I want to make a game for the App Store fairly soon, and if my game is to be enjoyable, I think 
    it'll have to rely on the novelties just like this game does. Maybe I'll conceive of funny characters
    or some good artwork, but I don't think I'm going to make a hit game trying to invent a new 
    mobile game mechanic.

    I'll let you know when I've got something good. Vi ses!
