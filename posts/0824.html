    After three daily articles in a row, this newest one is coming as a recap of the last several days. My 
    first few days in Sweden were spent mostly by myself as I arrived very early compared to most students 
    whom are now finally trickling in. During those first days, despite the pace of travel and the business of 
    finding my way around, there we're plenty of lulls and downtime to write blog posts. It seems when fun 
    things begin to actually happen, the blog posts get pushed by the wayside. It's most likely the days I 
    have time to write blog posts are the boring days of reflection on my interesting moments the days before. 
    One of my favorite comedians Mitch Hedberg had a joke where his buddy said to him, "hey come look at 
    this picture of me when I was younger", to which Mitch replied, "every picture is of you when you 
    were younger". In the same way, a blog post is a documentation of past events.

    I don't know how philosophic I want these posts to be. I'm not sure if people will read and enjoy my 
    thoughts, and I'm not sure what they want to get out of it. Do artists care about their audience base, or do they just 
    paint or play? Maybe the art is therapeutic to them and wasn't meant to be consumed. I'm sure there are 
    plenty of artists throughout history that required therapy through art, and I'm sure we know their names 
    because of the intense emotions they put into their work. My favorite musician Kurt Cobain certainly 
    didn't mind if people listened to him or not. In fact, he hated being famous and how superficial his 
    relationships became. He was one of the greatest singers because he had this quality called "release". 
    He could yell without yelling and push his voice without fear. Most all singers hit a glass ceiling 
    because they are trying to contain their voice or control it. In the same way, I guess I should write 
    thoughts as they come and as fearlessly as I can, trying my best to maintain a voice without reserving myself 
    and creating a glass ceiling.

    The last few days while mostly boring and uneventful, I had some good moments. I was able to finish some 
    code for a project I'm working on with another Purdue student and begin getting our app tested and into 
    user's hands. I met my buddy group leader, as well as some floor mates who later met me for dinner at 
    a local pub. The pub, although being totally Swedish, had amazing chicken wings. I know nothing of 
    Sweden or if they typically make chicken wings, but I did notice the local McDonald's sold chicken 
    wings, unlike the United States. So maybe the Swedes enjoy chicken more than we do. If that's the case 
    great, I love me some wings.

    There's a common rule when meeting people that goes something like you should never bring up politics 
    or religion ever ever ever. Well, all of my meetings with people over food have gotten into the realm 
    of politics, religion, or both. I'm having a hard time deciding if it is coincidental or not. I myself 
    love reading about politics and would say I keep myself in the loop pretty well and can keep up with most 
    all things politics. Maybe I'm driving conversations towards politics, but maybe as international students 
    we're very inquisitive of the other person's culture and state, which naturally leads into the realm of 
    politics. Either way, I hope this trend continues. What a bad thing to repress political conversation, 
    in the name of courteousness. The way I see it, you should be changing your mind about something about 
    every year of your life. To think you have all the correct thoughts as a 20 something is insane, and 
    not talking to people about your beliefs is how you keep them forever and never challenge them. Talking,  
    questioning, and challenging (usually) exposes the best ideas. If your thoughts didn't stand up, great, because 
    now you just kicked something stupid you would've held onto for potentially a long time. The alternative 
    is even better, the ability to help someone else along and show them the way out of bad logic or what 
    have you.

    I'll finish with this thought. We should strive to have "release" in all we do. Take it from Walt Disney, 
    "Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."
