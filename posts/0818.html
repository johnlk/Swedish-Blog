    The 18th marks my first day in Sweden. I had just spent around 13 hours traveling from O'Hare airport 
    to Arlanda in Sweden. Being as I couldn't get into my Uppsala apartment until Monday, 
    I spent the weekend in Stockholm which was just a 20 min train ride away.

    The picture above is a photo I took almost immediately after I got off my plane after landing at Arlanda. 
    I had only received about 90 mins of sleep on the seven hour flight, and I certainly wouldn't describe it 
    as good sleep as the sleep came in irregular twenty minute intervals. I did enjoy that the plane had episodes 
    of "Nathan for You" to watch. I ended up watching all four of the available episodes. After getting off 
    the plane, getting my luggage, and asking someone about how to get to Stockholm, I was finally on a train 
    towards Stockholm. My first impression of Sweden is the green scenery. Lots of trees and green. The usual 
    corn and soybean fields I was used to seeing in Indiana were replaced by plains of green grass.

    Once I had finally arrived in Stockholm it was around 7am, which was a late 1am at home. While I was tired 
    from traveling the past day and was wanting to rest, I needed to find a hotel to stay. Using google maps, I 
    lugged my luggage up the cobblestone roads looking for a hotel. I ended up stopping at three different 
    hotels all of which were full due to a festival being in town. After the third hotel, I booked a room at the 
    Sheraton online on my phone and hailed an Ãœber. I could've walked to the Sheraton as I had to the others, 
    but I was already sweating like crazy and didn't want to look any more out of place then I already knew I did. 
    As a side note, it was 65 degrees or so with a slight breeze which ended up being heavenly once I started 
    sweating, so it certainly could've been worse.

    My room was super nice and featured a US outlet and a king size bed, which I would eventually pass out on 
    around 1pm for a three hour nap. My first meal in Stockholm was at a place called Max, which is probably 
    the Swedish equivalent of McDonalds. It was a pretty good burger with nothing unexpected. The Coke I had 
    ordered was just a slightly different taste than I was used to. The Coke in Stockholm had a slightly stronger 
    aftertaste; the pop was a bit more bitter than the U.S. version.

    Pretty much everyone in Sweden speaks perfect English, and I never had any trouble navigating around the 
    city or talking to people. The English I hear in Sweden is even better than some of my professors at home, 
    but to be fair the Swedes have been learning English since elementary school.
