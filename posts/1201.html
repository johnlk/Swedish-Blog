    I'm writing this blog while simultaneously indulging in my new favorite thing. I read an article about 
    this growing trend in music listening called "8d Audio". Apparently, the technology for ambisonics has 
    been around since the 90's, but it's really starting to take off right now. This article gave all these
    testimonials from people claiming they were transported to a new world wrapping them in music from all
    sides. Maybe I'm exaggerating what they had to say about the technology, but when I checked it out for 
    myself, all my expectations were shattered. It's a brand new way to enjoy music. You feel like Freddie
    Mercury is singing to you when you listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if2lPD6_bX4">
    8d Bohemian Rhapsody</a>. I might have a slightly
    better experience too because I have expensive Bose noise cancelling headphones, but the effect is still
    good with regular old iPhone headphones too.

    Freud or someone categorized the types of happiness, one of them being the aesthetic happiness you experience
    when you see a beautiful painting or listen to a good song. I'm certainly deep into this zone of aesthetic
    happiness right now, but it's also coupled with this pleasure of reminisce too because I'm listening to 
    an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4XFwFQCYzs&list=PLPz_fodW3Kn-h8jTp_495B7A2S9JcLgK4">
    Owl City playlist</a>. I hope I'm not overhyping it, but you have to go check it out. I also
    found this great song, <a href="https://youtu.be/QB9EB8mTKcc">Lucid Dreams</a> which has been in my head
    for two days now.

    We live in a truly amazing time. I can call upon a seemingly endless stream of music content, some of which 
    has the potential to make me happy. We're all just on a rock in the solar system, which is revolving around
    this massive star responsible for maintaining our life, which in turn is rotating around our milky way's
    galactic center, which is also revolving around some more massive object yet. Someone has made 
    a song, and that song has hit my ears causing a release of serotonin. But about this wonderful ability
    to call on an infinite stream of content, while amazing, has the potential to make a population of people
    afraid of boredom and being alone.

    I was discussing this issue with someone last night, about how people are afraid of boredom. I relayed 
    to her this quote I remembered reading as best as I could at the time; however, since then I found 
    the original
    line by Pascal, "[a]ll of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone". 
    We thought if you're constantly being stimulated by your phone or other people, you'll never
    have a chance to let ideas happen. We surmised true creativity and the synthesis of ideas 
    come from the moments between periods of stimulation, during the downtime.

    My challenge for the reader is to try today to just sit and do nothing for fifteen or so minutes. If you
    have to cheat, listen to some 8d audio tracks while you try to sit still. Vi ses!
