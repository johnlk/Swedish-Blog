    I did laundry today and was reminded of how great clean sheets are, so here's an ode to clean sheets.<br><br>
    <b><u>Ode to Clean Sheets:</u></b><br>
    As soft as you feel,<br>
    as good as you smell,<br>
    the task of sleep<br>
    is a serene privilege.<br>
    Cotton embraces the<br>
    skin like warm motherly<br>
    hands, then patiently<br>
    waits for my return.<br>
    My slight grease and grime<br>
    erodes your appeal, but<br>
    yields a chance to enjoy<br>
    your presence every week.

    Last Friday night after my exam, I went to a pub with a few friends. I had ridden my bike for about five 
    minutes to a meeting location, locked my bike at a supermarket, then the group of us walked to the pub.
    After drinks and things wound down, I got back to my bike only to find my bike lock was jammed. I could 
    place the key all the way into the lock mechanism, but the key wouldn't turn at all. Chalking the 
    inconvenience up to a fluke of the cold weather, I walked all the way back. What would've taken me five
    minutes on a bike took me a half an hour by foot.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day, Saturday, I got up and walked all the way back out to the supermarket to find the exact
    same circumstances, a bike lock that just wouldn't open. I had been kind of lucky because the bike was 
    locked around to back tire to the frame and not to a fence or something. Maybe you're guessing what I'm 
    gonna say next. I carried my bike all the way back to Flogsta. A half hour walk turned into about an hour
    with lots of breaks to rest then picking up the bike again. I could let the front tire down as it was 
    free moving but I couldn't drag the back tire. I would've just found a bike shop to help me in my situation,
    but they were all closed for the weekend. In addition, I didn't want to just leave my bike at the 
    supermarket for two more days, so I carried it back. 
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a bike shop in Flogsta I was able to visit today where the owner let me use his giant wire cutters
    to cut the cheap bike lock. Of course I had to buy another bike lock in the old one's place, but I'm just
    glad I'm mobile again. Plus, the bike carrying was a great workout on Saturday I'm sure. I had a lot of
    time to think and be alone the whole way back too.

    I have yet another exam on Thursday, but I can't bring myself to do any good studying for it. I have this 
    problem from time to time where I hit a patch of a couple of weeks where I just don't want to do anything. 
    Now when I say I don't want to do 
    anything, I'm still doing plenty of coding, blog writing, drawing, reading, etc., I'm just not in the 
    mood to do what I'm supposed to. I had a bad case of it this last summer working on a part of Stuut
    that was particularly un-fun. I broke through it with some alcohol and discipline. Right now, I 
    believe my motivation for school or lack thereof to be coming from the apathy of the material. 
    Unlike my last slump, if this one is truly caused by class apathy, then it'll fix itself when I get
    new classes in a week. In the meantime however, I'll have to study for my exam all the same.

    I will say I'm starting to get excited by game development. I have a lot of mobile game development ideas
    bouncing around in my head, but am so new to the development environment that the time required to 
    implement said ideas is too much of a sacrifice during my exam week. My mobile game brainstorms
    are causing me to reminisce to the days of middle school with a game called Doodle Jump. My super good 
    friend at the time Ben Linky and I played the hell out of that game. I hope I can make a fun
    game even if it doesn't make any money; I'll just be glad to have people playing it. My Alexa skill 
    has a lot of success with hundreds of new users every single week, but I think this could be because
    of the niche market. The iOS app market on the other hand is saturated with games, 
    and I think my chances of a successful
    game are lesser. But like I said, I'm just hoping to make something enjoyable for my friends and me.
    I'll certainly let the blog know when I've got something good.
