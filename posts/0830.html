    Above is a video of my very first backflip in Sweden. Not bad after not having done it in about 2 weeks. One 
    of the guys in my buddy group was a competitive diver all the way up to the collegiate level, and he was 
    able to give some pointers on my backflip.

    Well, when I go back and recount today's events, all I will remember is the half an hour discussion I had on 
    feminism with a gender studies student. I won't get into the conversation at all, but there were a lot of 
    disagreements. I wasn't offended at any point, but I kept feeling like she was upset with things I had to 
    say. I feel like I'm a nice guy. I certainly don't go out of my way to try and offend people or attack their
    beliefs, but I want to know why people believe what they believe. If I am wrong on an issue, I want to know 
    why and be corrected; however, to get to a point where I am able to understand their level of thinking, I 
    have to risk being offensive. I have to probe and ask about things they may take for granted as obvious. 
    I hope I can still be friends with her.

    I also was able to get my Uppsala University student ID card today, and I feel like a true Swedish student 
    now. The people who took my picture actually said I was the happiest looking student they had seen on an 
    ID photo. My class schedule is pretty relaxed with just 3-4 classes a week depending on the week, so I 
    should have plenty of time to travel to a few places in Europe while everything is close. I definitely  
    want to go to Florence, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen, but I also want to go with friends instead of being 
    all by my lonesome. I have made several very quick friends here in Uppsala as almost all the exchange 
    students are super friendly, outgoing, and optimistic. Getting to all of those places with the friends
    I've met might require me to organize the trips and ask them to join. I'll get on that soon!

    As it happens, I had a chance to practice my Spanish some more today with some Spaniards. It might 
    actually be pretty funny to come back from Sweden after a semester of study reporting that I'm 
    fluent in Spanish instead of Swedish.
