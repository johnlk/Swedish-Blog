    I finished a book today called "The reason for God" by Timothy Keller. I was spurred to read it by the 
    encouragement of my Christian friends from home. I had been raised a Christian and was very adamant about
    my faith all through high school. After studying the theory of evolution and reading books on our 
    universe by Stephen Hawking, I had a lot of trouble combining this new information with my 
    faith. This post is certainly not a defense of my new faith, or lack thereof, but just a giving 
    of context. As it is now, I come down on the side of not believing in God, but I'm totally open 
    to the idea. In fact, it's so much easier to believe in the idea of a creator having a specific plan 
    for me, however solipsistic the idea. To believe someone will take care to equalize all atrocities 
    and injustices experienced here on earth; to know murders and terrorists will receive a punishment not 
    achievable on earth in some instances. What a delight to believe you'll see your whole family again 
    after death in the eternal bliss that is heaven. As it is however, I am unable to go on believing it 
    anymore.

    In Timothy Keller's book, he goes through some theological issues people usually have with Christianity  
    including why a loving God would send people to hell, or if there can only be one correct religion. All 
    these points were reasonable theologically, and I had no issue with them. I certainly gained a new perspective 
    on the accuracy of the accounts of the bible; however, Keller still left questions unanswered and 
    misrepresented some atheistic positions held by Dawkins and Hitches. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As far as I could tell Keller's case against Atheism came down on the idea that if there is no divine creator
    then each of our lives have no true purpose, and morality goes right out the window. What a narrow
    view of our species that we have to be told what's right and wrong, not even by God himself, but someone who 
    is the messenger for God. This is an extremely slippery territory. It's all fine and dandy to believe this
    while also believing in Christ's words, but take the words of Mohammad who was supposed to be a messenger for 
    God and you have a morality based on the killing of infidels and the conquering of the world. Let me also 
    pose a question. Is there a single thing a God fearing individual can do in the name of God for the good 
    of the world that an atheist such as myself could not do? I submit the answer to be no. More than that, if 
    I were to ask you to come up with something horribly wicked an individual could do only if they were religiously 
    motivated, I'm sure you could come up with an example extremely quickly.
    On the meaning of life, I also find it a very narrow and bleak view of the world and life therein to believe
    your meaning has to be given to you from upstairs. All of us should want to make advances in science, 
    technology, or even politics such that our fellow brothers and sisters should have an easier life after ours.
    I'm not sure why our value or worth has to come from the feeling that someone is listening to our prayers, it
    seems shallow to me.

    On the resurrection of Jesus, I wasn't certain about the validity of the biblical accounts, and this book gave 
    me some more information on the event. Keller's support of the validity of the accounts of Jesus's 
    resurrection stem from the fact that it was so unbelievable that no scholar would want to report it, except 
    if it were true. He gives a working account of the Jewish and Roman beliefs of the time and how unbelievable 
    it would've been to believe someone were resurrected. Even easier to explain, the gospel accounts have women 
    as the first witnesses to the rolled back tomb. At the time, female accounts were considered less than a man's 
    and someone making up the story certainly would've just made the witnesses men. Maybe, I understand the logic, 
    but here's this. I'll give you the miracle that Jesus was resurrected, hell Lazarus, the daughter of Jairus, 
    and a man from Nain were 
    raised from the dead in the gospel accounts without any word about where they had been or what they had experienced.
    What's more is that Jesus opened up the tombs of the saints in Matthew 27:50-53 after his resurrection. Although 
    this last biblical account is debated whether it is figurative or not, it almost seems that 
    resurrection was quite a banality at the time rather 
    than a great miraculous singularity as Keller seems to be painting it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Kelly also describes the quick founding of Christianity and the radically explosive growth after the resurrection
    as evidence the event must have been real. If you want to show the growth of a religion as an example of its
    validity, then I'll show you to Islam where members are constantly sacrificing everything in the pursuit of 
    the religions tenants. Keller would never believe however that Islam has any validity just because of its fast 
    growth and the members' willingness to sacrifice, but this is exactly how he argues about the validity of the 
    resurrection account of Jesus.

    All these existential thoughts and talk about the meaning of life are making me think about my ex-girlfriend. I 
    can't explain why. Maybe it's because when you think about your purpose in life, it's natural to think about 
    your family, or in my case a future one. Certainly if I had a child, raising it well would be a lot of my 
    life. I have thoughts sometimes that I made the wrong decision when it came to breaking up with her. I'm not 
    sure if everyone has these thoughts even if it wasn't meant to be, or if I really am acknowledging some truth. 
    I believe it to be the former. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll finish with the acknowledgement that with all things I'm often wrong. I can't find the exact quote, but Teddy 
    Roosevelt said something to the effect of, "I wish to be right just 40% of the time". I'm wrong a lot, 
    and knowing this encourages me to stay humble and test my opinions. As it is, I could be 
    totally wrong about my current irreligious views. This is simply where I am now in my life given the 
    information I've received.
