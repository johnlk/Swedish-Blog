    Today was my first day of school in Uppsala Universitet. Before my class began at 10:15 am, I was hoping to 
    get a good night sleep for my first day. I had passed out around 1 am and was sleeping super well. Then 
    my phone started buzzing, because someone was calling me. It was 2:40 in the morning, so I ignored it. 
    After the fifth call, I decided to answer. It wasn't all 
    bad though because it was a friend from Purdue who was also studying abroad. She was planning a trip 
    this weekend to Naples Italy and wanted to include me, but that also meant I had to agree to the purchasing 
    of plane tickets etc. Certainly a good reason for having been woken up, but after organizing final trip 
    details, it was hard to fall back asleep.

    I ended up watching Archer on Netflix until about 4 am when my sister texted me and asked me to get off. 
    For those who don't know, if you're poor and have the cheapest Netflix plan, only one user on the account 
    may view content at one time, ergo my sister wanted me off so she could watch her shows. Ah yes, the first
    text I've received from sister abroad was about me getting off Netflix. Man, I usually don't have an 
    issue falling asleep, but last night was a bear. I even used the trick that almost never fails; I play
    Jim Gaffigan on Spotify. Don't ask me why, but his soothing soft voice always puts me to sleep, except 
    for last night.

    I woke up in plenty of time for getting to my class; however, my bike's rear tire went flat not two 
    minutes after I left my dorm, turning my fifteen minute trip to class into a twenty-five minute one. It also 
    meant me being late to class for my first day. Something you may not think about or notice, but when
    one of your bike tires goes completely pancake on you, the energy required to keep the bike going 
    almost doubles. Couple the extra exertion with the nerves of being late, and I ended up coming to lecture
    super sweaty, probably looking like I had just run to class. I say these things simply because they 
    happened, not because any of them were really a big deal.

    This post is defiantly not as philosophic as the others, it's just about what I did.
    I bought a Swedish phone plan today and also got a haircut. Oh my goodness, I needed
    a haircut so bad. My hair hadn't been cut since probably June and it was an afro as far as I'm concerned.
    The phone plan was a relief as well because it includes data roaming outside of Sweden for travel.

    Everything on this journey abroad so far has just been a matter of getting more comfortable. The first 
    day you're here it's awkward because you don't know anyone or where you're supposed to go for things, or even
    how the outlets work. But after solving simple problems every day you start to feel pretty comfortable. I felt pretty 
    comfortable after I figured out my classes and my schedule, and once I got a bike. Before I had a bike, 
    getting to town was a forty-minute walk. My next step towards more comfortability would be getting good 
    at ordering food in Swedish. Swedish isn't that hard grammatically or anything that I can tell, but the 
    pronunciation is what's hard. It's like English in that there's not a lot of phonetic rules that are 
    adhered to. Anyways, I would be pretty pleased if I could order in Swedish and have basic conversations with 
    strangers.

    I actually was told a joke by a Swede over the weekend. He said, "what do you call someone who only speaks 
    one language?". To which I relied, "unilingual?". He said, "no, you call them American". Ah yes. Well 
    I'll have to learn the language before I leave and be un-American in that sense.

    That's it. Vi ses!
