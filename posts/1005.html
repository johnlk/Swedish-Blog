    I usually have a picture recently taken to introduce a blog post; however, nothing picture worthy has 
    happened this last week and I don't want to force bad content.
  </p>
  <p>
    This last week has been rather boring. I'm starting to grow disinterested in my coursework. I have a class
    on the technologies and systems that support the internet. It's fine learning all the theory, but I 
    have this apathy coming from a thought that sounds about like, "even if I don't understand any of how the 
    internet works, there are plenty of people who will take care of it". It really is amazing how your brain 
    functions. If I sit down to study a chapter from the textbook with the mentality of, "I'm never going to 
    need to know this" my brain just doesn't turn on the recorder and none of the information sticks. The exact 
    same phenomenon is happening in my Swedish class. I want to learn Swedish for the sake of ordering in 
    restaurants and what have you, but after I come back to the US I'm not going to be able to talk to 
    any other Swedish speakers. 
    My brain isn't fooled and doesn't spend the resources on learning in the same way I do with Spanish.
    The difference is simply my mentality going into studying.
    I guess that's why it's important for teachers to express the importance of the information being taught, not
    just spew the material.

    I'm certainly looking forward to the term switching here in a couple weeks such that I can get some new 
    classes. I feel like a lot of my life I'm looking forward to something in the future. This summer while 
    working at 
    Salesforce I definitely had a lot of fun, but I was also looking forward to not having to work anymore and
    starting school in Sweden. Now that I'm in Sweden, I'm totally having fun, but I'm looking forward to coming 
    back to Purdue and spending time with friends and with the relationships I have a lot more time invested in. 
    I'm worried 
    I can't actually be happy if I'm constantly looking to the future in eager anticipation. Can I truly enjoy
    what's in front of me now? I once heard after you retire and have nothing left in your life to look forward
    to, you can fully experience happiness. Part of that might also be because after retiring, the next major
    life event is death and so you kind of have to love the present. As young as I am, I have a lot of life 
    experiences to look forward to.
  </p>
  <p>
    None of this is to say that I'm not happy, because I am. I'm just thinking. I think a lot. I hope my thoughts
    can be interesting to someone else. I can't look outside of my own blog and critically analyze if it's 
    interesting or not. The Chinese have a saying, "don't ask the fish how the water tastes", and don't ask me if
    my blog is interesting or well written. I hope it is. Maybe a frequent reader can notice an improvement in 
    my writing, or can pick up on what type of mood I'm in while writing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if my posts aren't enjoyable to other people, in ten years I will enjoying coming back and reading my 
    thoughts. As they say, everybody's favorite topic is themselves. Try to keep this in mind when talking to 
    people. Dale Carnegie says the best conversationalist asks questions about other people that get them 
    to talk about their life, career, or anything that excites them really. I guess if that's true there's 
    certainly less pressure to tell a good story or be funny if you can just ask questions of another person.
    I think there's a topic between every group of people in the world that both parties can relate to in a
    stimulating way. I've had this experience when talking to someone about comedians. Miraculously, they
    seemed to listen to about as much stand up as I did, which at the time was impressive. I want to know the
    secret of getting to that awesome mutual conversation topic without probing like an interviewer.

    Speaking of interviews, I have one in about 77 mins. I should probably be prepping for that. Vi ses!
