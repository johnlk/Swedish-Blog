    Today was a good day because I was able to get 10,000 steps in before noon just walking around exploring 
    the city. I was also able to meet up with some other Purdue students. These students were studying as 
    exchange students at the Swedish Royal Institute KTH in Stockholm. I was able to meet up with them at 
    a barbecue their school was having for their arriving international students. I was worried I wouldn't 
    be able to enter because I didn't have the wristband denoting a KTH international student, but it worked 
    out because they let me in anyway. This barbecue had Germans, Austrians, Spaniards, you name it. I was 
    able to talk with a couple Catalans from Madrid that spoke really good English. It was great because 
    although everyone was from different countries, they all spoke in English to each other. English is the 
    universal language everyone is learning, especially if you're an engineering student in Europe.

    I was able to end my day hanging out with those Purdue students and an Austrian student we had met. 
    We went out and got a drink at a place we had found on an app that displayed bars with beers under 30 
    krona, which is like $3.30. It was my very first time in a bar as I'm only 20 and that doesn't fly in 
    the U.S.; however, the Europeans didn't even check my ID. Different cultures are great.
