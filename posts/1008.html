    I read two books last week, and I'm reading another this week. As a kid, and through the majority of 
    schooling, I remember hating reading. Now that I'm in college and reading on my own, I actually enjoy it.
    Why is it school can come to make you hate something? Is it because when I'm reading on my own now, I know
    there's not an essay to write or a test to take soon after finishing? Is it because I'm freely choosing 
    which books I want to read?
    I don't know, I'm not a psych major. Anecdotally, I would say there does exist some animosity when it comes
    to following instruction. My parents, especially my dad, were always asking if I had brushed my teeth when I
    was a kid. It was as if him asking me if I had brushed my teeth made me want to un-brush
    my teeth had I brushed them. But looking from his position, if the child was constantly saying no to 
    the question, then clearly reminders were in order.

    I definitely would have benefited had I as a child enjoyed brushing my teeth and reading as much as I do now.
    It isn't a joke. I had tons of cavities as a kid. We're talking sometimes four or five cavities found
    during one dentist visit. I know in school we did have the option of choosing our own books to read for 
    some projects. I don't remember writing those reports with any more gusto than the others. Maybe I disliked
    my English teachers. In my experience, they were certainly the laziest teachers. I can't be surprised. When it 
    comes to being a teacher, which I'm sure isn't hard, becoming an English teacher has got to be the 
    easiest.

    Interviewer: Can you speak English?<br>
    Potential English Teacher: Yes. <br>
    Interviewer: Do you know the difference between a demonstrative and an attributive adjective? <br>
    Potential English Teacher: No. <br>
    Interviewer: Me either, but you can just look it up the day before you have to give the lesson. You're hired.

    This isn't to say all my English teachers were bad, because they weren't. In fact, my Sophomore and Senior 
    year of high school English teachers were very smart and made me both a better reader and writer. I'm just
    wondering how we could get more kids to enjoy reading, or at least stop making schools make their students
    hate it. I wonder if today's kids are worse off because of the distractions that await them upon returning
    home, like the Xbox and iPad. If this were the case, then we should see an equal lack of homework completion
    in other subjects, not just English.

    Some people still despise reading even out of school. I don't know if you know this, but books exist on almost
    any topic. You can step into some of the greatest and most interesting minds of all time, Richard Feynman, 
    Aristotle, or even 
    Anne Frank just by picking up a book. Reading is learning from another person just like you did with almost 
    any other skill you've learned so far, be it driving, speaking well, or weightlifting. Imagine if you could
    have Arnold Schwarzenegger as a personal trainer. It is commonly argued Arnold Schwarzenegger had one of 
    the greatest bodies ever built. You could step inside his mind and his thought process today, if you just 
    read his books.

    In the <i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> Stephen R. Covey gives a model for how we should spend 
    our time. He builds two categories of task that every person has to do, important and non-important. He 
    then crosses these attributes with two more that describe tasks as either urgent or non-urgent. You can
    see an example below. We almost always spend all of our time in the urgent column. We do things important
    for right now. To build character, to invest in the future, we should spend our time in quadrant 2.
    Those tasks which are important but not urgent are the ones that make us better listeners, 
    better conversationalists, better friends, and better people.

    I hope you're encouraged a little by what's been said. I hope you can commit to learning something new 
    this week in a book. Vi ses!
