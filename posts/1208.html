    My birthday is the 9th, which falls on a Sunday this year. Sunday is certainly not a convenient 
    time for a party, so I celebrated my birthday yesterday. I'm not disappointed in any way about last night.
    All my Spanish friends came to the party, and a lot of my friends who don't live in Flogsta made 
    it out to the party as well. Some of my friends as it happened never had the chance to experience
    the Flogsta scream first hand. For those unfamiliar with the Flogsta scream, it's a tradition
    where the residents of Flogsta belt out and scream at 10pm every night. My friends and I screamed 
    along with the rest of Flogsta last night and had a lot of fun with it.

    My Spanish friends even went out of their way to make me a chocolate birthday cake. I'm one who 
    doesn't think too much about birthdays including my own. To me, it's just a day not to be 
    distinguished from any other. But when your friends make your birthday a big deal and do something
    nice for you, it's a great feeling. I can't say I've given my full appreciation toward my friends
    or family on their birthdays', but I'm going to start making more of a point to make other people
    feel special on their birthday.

    After drinking for a couple of hours, some of my friends continued the party at VÃ¤rmlands club with me;
    however, the others were welcome to stay on my corridor, and I left them access to my room and bathroom.
    When I returned from the club around 1am, I came back to a room situation I found funny rather than 
    say infuriating. Some people or person went and turned everything in my room upside down including 
    my bed. Nothing was safe, and they turned over drawer units and even some Spanish study notes I had
    posted on the wall above my desk. Once again, I had a sense of humor about it as it didn't take too 
    long to put back, and they didn't break 
    anything. I guess never mix alcohol and boredom or you'll have drunks looking for something funny to do.

    I don't have any crazy stories to tell; my mom reads this blog. One story I can tell though 
    happened before 
    my party. In Sweden, drinks with alcohol content greater than 3.5% are controlled by the government. 
    You have to go these government run stores called "systembolaget" which is translated to "the 
    system store". Anywho, I had to ride my bike to go buy some drinks, and on my way back I had one bag 
    with three drinks. I hung the bag on the left side of my handlebars and without a counterbalance on the
    other side, my bike pulled left. Almost halfway back home I went to pull my hat down over my ears
    a little more and in the one second or so I had both my hands of the handlebars, the front wheel
    pulled left and I fell off my bike. This is common sense in hindsight that I should have always kept 
    my hands on my handlebars if I had a bag with a bunch of weight on the one side. Really the crash
    was a penalty of Hubris because I never dreamed I would fall off a bike. The last time I fell of my
    bike I was probably 5 years old or something. I have excellent balance and can ride a unicycle, but
    I fell yesterday. Two of my three drinks survived the fall, but I had peppermint vodka that met its
    doom by smashing into the ground. 25 euros wasted. The shattered remains of the glass of peppermint
    vodka sat in the entrance of my room, giving it a nice aroma, so maybe it wasn't a total waste.

    I'm coming back to good ol' Warsaw Indiana in two weeks. I am both excited to see my friends and family
    back home, but I'm equally sad about leaving behind these friends I have been developing a relationship
    with for five months now. I'll have more to say later. Vi ses!
