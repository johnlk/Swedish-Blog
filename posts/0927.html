    It's about time I did another check in via my blog. Today I woke up for a class that was a twenty min bike 
    ride from my dorm. The class was actually a three hour lab beginning at 8:15 am. There's a pride associated 
    with waking up early and doing something you know you ought to do, like going to class even when it's early
    and cold. It's so easy to just stay in bed, but if you don't give in and do what 
    you're supposed to, there's a great sense of accomplishment. It's this tiny inner voice that tells me to do what
    it knows to be good for me. CS Lewis describes this inner voice as our innate sense of right and wrong 
    that comes from the spirit parts of our body/soul. Maybe, all I know is I feel bad if I start my day off
    by doing something lazy like skipping class.

    I like these little moments of satisfaction when reflecting on something done well like riding to class 
    in the rain. I've been thinking about creating a challenge for myself that would only help my character 
    grow by getting me out of my comfort zone, but would also feed this desire for moments of satisfaction 
    after having done something hard. I was thinking the first part of the challenge would be smiling at 5 
    strangers every day. Such an easy thing to do really, but somewhat of an awkward thing for me, so it seems
    like an appropriate challenge. Maybe I could do something with meeting or complimenting people too? I'm not
    sure, but I'll be sure to let the blog know once I've defined the challenges I want to complete day to day.

    I've been pretty busy these last couple weeks working on my company and job applications. I've received a 
    return offer from Salesforce to work with them this next summer, but I think I want to work at a small 
    company. I don't want to jinx anything by talking about it, so I won't, but understand I now have a 
    commitment to re-learning all my algorithms and data structures. So this weekend I'll have to 
    make time to study for a class that I already passed last year because an employer wants to know that I 
    in fact still remember big O. I should be studying for my current classes, or working on my Swedish, or 
    Spanish, and there is plenty of work to do for Stuut my company. I constantly have this internal pressure
    to be productive. It's great when I follow this voice and do a lot of stuff, but I feel awful if I waste 
    a day.

    On language learning, I was listening to the Joe Rogan podcast with Elon Musk, and Musk was talking about 
    some of the research at Neuralink. He talked about how we all have this primal hindbrain that takes care
    of our involuntary actions like breathing and heart rate. Next, he explained how our neocortex and 
    our lobes developed around this hind brain like a second layer abstracted from our instincts to support 
    free thought and logic. Finally, he envisioned the possibility of an implant or chip that could assist 
    our frontal lobe by being the 3rd layer of the brain. As I was sitting in Swedish class today unable to 
    recall the words I needed to know to complete a worksheet, I just daydreamed about this chip that could
    translate for me. To never have to look up anything again because you have an absolute storage system 
    like that of a computer, right in your head.

    There's definitely an adoption period for stuff like this. Some will want a chip in their head tomorrow, 
    and others, including myself, will want to see the bugs worked out. I'm sure people might also associate 
    a chip in people's heads with the mark of the beast in revelation. I was also reading about meat like steak
    that could be grown in a lab. No cow, all the nutrients, but just grown in a petri dish. Sounds great, 
    and solves this massive factory farming problem that has encouraged all these vegetarians; however,
    the article described a remaining "ick factor" as some people still find it unsettling to eat meat that 
    came from a lab.

    That's it. Vi ses!
