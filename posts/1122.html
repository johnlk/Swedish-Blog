    Whelp it's been a minute since I've checked in. Not much has happened recently and school work has picked up,
    so the blog was pushed to the bottom of the priorities list.

    For almost a month now I've removed sugar from my diet. Well at least I thought I had until someone pointed
    out to me that there's sugar in the granola I eat for breakfast most mornings. To rephrase, I've dramatically  
    cut my sugar intake. Anyone who knows me knows I love to eat chocolate or oreos, especially after dinner.
    The dinning courts at Purdue would make some great cookies, and I always ate some. The motivation for 
    dropping sugar after dinner comes both from a hatred of my acne and a desire to improve my discipline.
    I'm a founder of an LLC, founder of a club, and studying abroad this semester. I would consider myself
    pretty disciplined, except when it came to eating junk food. I always ate a bunch of cookies without 
    any repercussions because I'm moderately active and have a high metabolism. I say no repercussions 
    because despite knowing the wives' tale about chocolate causing pimples, I've come to understand diet 
    doesn't have any impact on acne.

    I've had acne since the beginning of high school, and I only have a year left of college. So, a long time.
    All through middle school I had perfect skin while everyone else had pimples. I mistakenly thought I 
    won the biological lottery and wouldn't have to deal with acne. I was totally wrong and would say I
    was plagued with far worse skin issues than the average person. Getting to it, I figured it couldn't
    hurt to run a skin experiment in reducing sugar. After at least three weeks, maybe not a month quite 
    yet, I can say my skin appears to be in better condition. My face is much drier though too, which brings
    its own side effects including my lips being chapped all the time. I have to carry around chap stick with
    me now and apply it about once every two hours; otherwise, my lips will split from being dry. I don't know
    why I'm telling this story, I'll move on.

    I finally had a chance to read again after a small academic break and I finished Orwell's 1984. Pretty solid
    book, and it's amazing how closely the warnings apply to life 
    even today, a whole six decades after the book was published in 1949. I'm not sure if this is due to 
    Orwell's prescience or if the problems besetting most societies are relatively constant over a short amount
    of time. I will say certainly it's true our society hasn't changed too much, at least not structurally in 
    six decades, and there is something to be said about cultures facing the exact same problems. Vsauce
    has a great video on <a href="https://youtu.be/LD0x7ho_IYc">Juvenoia</a> and gives a couple quotes that 
    may of well have been written about today's youths. The Sunday Magazine in 1871 wrote, "[n]ow we fire 
    off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet 
    of paper". I would venture to guess most all problems have been dealt with before in the past, and I really
    should spend more time reading history. The exception to the proposition includes bleeding edge
    technology, like AI and the ethics of data centralization, because of course past societies didn't have 
    a chance to interact with it.

    I'm in Copenhagen this week and it's been fun, and cold. I went on a tour of Copenhagen today
    and had to meet my group at 8:30 am. It's amazing how easy it is to overestimate your ability to get out 
    of bed and be proactive while you're establishing a plan for the next morning. As an example, I made a plan
    last night to get up at 7:00 am and walk to a local breakfast shop quite out of my way, simply because it 
    looked really good. When the morning came, all I had time for was a to-go egg mcmuffin. The tour was really
    good, and I got to see the largest castle in Scandinavia. There was a couple on the tour with us, and at 
    one point we were missing the wife. The tour guide asked, "your wife?", to which this legend replied, 
    "what about her?" receiving much laughter.

    I screwed up and I purchased the wrong data plan that didn't include EU data roaming. So I'm without 
    data or phone service on my trip this week. This really sucked at the beginning, but I've just learned
    to plan my routes before I leave my hotel. If worst comes to worst, I can always duck into a McDonalds
    to use their free wi-fi. Being without data does however ruin what I usually do when traveling alone, 
    which is just walk around without a plan.

    I have much more to say about Denmark, but for now, vi ses!
